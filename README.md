Inspiread by Andrej Kaparthy's NotebookLM work (https://x.com/karpathy/status/1841594123381571863), I created a podcast from my blog article (https://jianbingdacong.wordpress.com/2024/03/27/%e8%bf%99%e5%8f%a5%e8%af%9d%e5%87%8f%e5%b0%91%e4%ba%86%e6%88%9180%e7%9a%84%e4%ba%ba%e9%99%85%e5%85%b3%e7%b3%bb%e7%84%a6%e8%99%91/).
I used NotebookLM (https://notebooklm.google.com/) to generate a 10-minute audio podcast of two people discussing this article. It was surprisingly good. They even added examples to the point, which was not included in the article, and it was quite smooth and causal, but to the point. 
I created a podcast channel in my YouTube account but could not upload the audio as it is not allowed, so I used Headliner (https://www.headliner.app/)
